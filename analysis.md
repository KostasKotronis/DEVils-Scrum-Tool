|---|-----------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Security                    | Password Requirements | The length should be between 8 and 32 characters. Password must contain at least one upper-case alphabetic character, one lower-case alphabetic character, one special character, and one numeric character. |
| 2 | Security                    | Password Encryption   | Passwords must be hashed using bcrypt function and a secure random salt before saving them to the database. This operation should be performed on the server side to prevent Dictionary and Brute Force Attack.  |
| 3 | Security                    | SSL Encryption        | Use SSL encryption to send sensitive data through the network like credit card numbers. Also, use an SSL certificate to make our customers trust us as a company.                                                |
| 4 | Security                    | Prevent SQL Injections | Validate user input data and shield the application from SQL injections. This can be achieved by thorough testing through the application development process to ensure that the system is safe from this kind of attacks. |
| 5 | Usability                   | Usability Heuristics   | User interface design must conform to Nielsen's usability heuristics. The user interface should be tested early in the design process to avoid common mistakes.                                                            |
| 6 | Usability                   | Consistency and System Standards | The user interface must be consistent.  1. The layout should be the same across the application.  2. The navigation bar must be in the same place. 3. Use the same wording and visualization for the same functions.       |
| 7 | Usability                   | Error Prevention                 | The user should be warned on the following situations: 1. When he/she is about to delete something. (e.g. A task from the todo list on the sprint page.) 2. The primary action should be emphasized. (e.g. Submit button in a form) |
| 8 | Usability                   | Minimalistic Design              | The user interface should follow minimalistic design: 1. The interface should be easy to get used to. 2. Lots of text should be avoided.                                                                                            |
